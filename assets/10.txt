What is squamous cell carcinoma?
Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common type of skin cancer that begins in the squamous cells, which make up the middle and outer layers of the skin.

Location?
SCC can occur anywhere on the body, but is most commonly found on areas frequently exposed to the sun, such as the face, ears, neck, lips, and backs of the hands.

Texture?
Lesions may appear as scaly red patches, open sores, elevated growths with a central depression, or warts; they may crust or bleed.

Shape?
SCCs are often irregular in shape and may grow rapidly.

Color?
They can be red, pink, or flesh-colored, and sometimes develop a crusted surface.
